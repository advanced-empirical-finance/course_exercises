Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| eval: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

But you can also use other languages in Quarto such as Python. Creating a code chunk, you need to click in insert, then execuatble cell and then choose the desired programming language. A short cut is is Ctlr+Alt+I.

The following cell is python, as you can read in the upper left corner.\$\$f(x)=x\^2\$\$

```{python}
#| eval: false

#Defining a function  in python
def f_p(x):
  
  return x**2

f_p(2)

```

Let's implement the same function but in R:

```{r}
#| eval: false

#Defining a function in R:

f_r <- function(x) {
  return(x^2)
}

f_r(2)

```
