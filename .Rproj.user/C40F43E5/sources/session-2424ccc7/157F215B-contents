# Beta Estimation

**Exercises:**

1. Read in the clean CRSP data (`crsp_monthly`) set from the `tidy_finance_*.sqlite` file (if you do not recall how to do this, check the previous chapter)
1. Read in the Fama-French monthly market returns (`factors_ff_monthly`) from the database
1. Compute the market beta $\beta_\text{AAPL}$ of ticker `AAPL` (`permno == 14593`). You can use the function `lm()` (R) or `smf.ols` (Python) for that purpose (alternatively: compute the well-known OLS estimate $(X'X)^{-1}X'Y$ on your own).
1. For monthly data, it is common to compute $\beta_i$ based on a rolling window of length five years. Implement a rolling procedure that estimates assets market beta each month based on the last 60 observations. You can use the package `slider` (R), `statsmodels.regression.rolling` (Python), or a simple `for` loop. (*Note*: this is going to be a time-consuming computational task)
1. Store the beta estimates in the `tidy_finance_*.sqlite` database as `beta_exercise` (the file `tidy_finance_*.sqlite` already contains a table `beta` with the estimated values from the textbook - it may be a good idea to compare your results with the ones we get).
1. Provide summary statistics for the cross-section of estimated betas
1. What is the theoretical prediction of CAPM concerning the relationship between market beta and expected returns? What would you expect if you create portfolios based on beta (you create a high- and a low-beta portfolio each month and track the performance over time)? How should the expected returns differ between high and low-beta portfolios?

**Solutions:**
All solutions are provided in the book chapter [Beta estimation (R version)](https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/beta-estimation.html) or [Beta estimation (Python version)](https://www.tidy-finance.org/python/beta-estimation.html)

# Univariate sorts

**Exercises:**

1. Load the monthly CRSP file, the Fama-French Factors, and the estimated betas from the `tidy_finance_*.sqlite` database. 
1. Create portfolio sorts based on the *lagged* beta. Specifically, you compute the breakpoint as the median *lag* beta each month. Then, you compute the returns of a portfolio that invests only in the stocks with a higher beta than the breakpoint and a portfolio that invests only in the stocks with a lower beta than the breakpoints. The portfolio weights can either be equal or value-weighted.
1. What are the monthly excess returns of both portfolios?
1. Does a portfolio that goes long high beta stocks and short low beta stocks yield an excess return significantly different from zero?
1. Write a general function for portfolio sorts based on a variable number of breakpoints. Then, compute portfolio returns based on *lagged* beta decile sorts. 
1. What is the CAPM alpha of the ten portfolio returns? Is this finding in line with your expectations based on the CAPM implications?
1. Does a high beta minus low beta portfolio yield abnormal excess returns? 

**Solutions:**
All solutions are provided in the book chapter [Univariate portfolio sorts (R Version)](https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/univariate-portfolio-sorts.html) or [Univariate portfolio sorts (Python Version)](https://www.tidy-finance.org/python/univariate-portfolio-sorts.html)
